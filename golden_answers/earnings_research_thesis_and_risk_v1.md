# Golden Answer: Earnings Research Thesis and Risk (v1)

This file sketches the structure and key elements of a **PM-quality answer**
for the eval `earnings_research_thesis_and_risk_v1`.

## 1. Business and Thesis Summary

- 2–3 paragraphs summarizing:
  - What the company does,
  - Its main economic engine (revenue drivers, unit economics),
  - The proposed long or short thesis in plain language.

## 2. Key Drivers and KPIs

- Bullet list of the 4–6 most important fundamental drivers:
  - Volumes / units,
  - Pricing / mix,
  - Cost structure and operating leverage,
  - Capex / investment intensity,
  - Balance sheet / liquidity if relevant.
- For each driver, a short note on:
  - Base case trajectory,
  - What would constitute a positive or negative surprise.

## 3. Risks (Idiosyncratic, Sector, Macro)

- Separate subsections for:
  - **Idiosyncratic risks** – execution, competition, product risk,
    governance, etc.
  - **Sector/theme risks** – industry cycle, regulatory shifts, disruption.
  - **Macro risks** – rates, FX, GDP, credit conditions.
- For each risk, a sentence on how it would impact the thesis and what
  it would do to conviction and sizing.

## 4. Event Path and Conviction Levers

- Ordered list of key events over the next 6–12 months:
  - Upcoming earnings, product launches, regulatory decisions,
    capital structure events (buybacks, issuance, M&A), etc.
- For each event:
  - What “good”, “base”, and “bad” look like,
  - How each outcome would change:
    - Thesis confidence,
    - Position size in risk units (even if the thesis direction stays the same).

## 5. Sizing and Role in a Long/Short Portfolio

- Proposed position expressed in **risk units** (and optionally % of NAV),
  with:
  - Approximate contribution to portfolio volatility / drawdown,
  - Factor vs idiosyncratic risk split,
  - Correlation with key existing positions.
- Role in the book:
  - Core alpha source, hedge, pair leg, tactical trade, etc.
- Risk limits:
  - Max risk units allocated,
  - Clear conditions for trimming or exiting.

This golden answer is used as a **reference pattern**: model outputs are
scored on how closely they match this structure, depth, and risk logic,
rather than on literal wording.
