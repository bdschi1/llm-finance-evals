# Risk logic golden answer – Risk case 1 (Long Acme MedTech)

**Fundamental risks**

- Slower adoption of the new surgical platform due to surgeon learning curves, hospital capital constraints, or better-than-expected competitor products.
- Adverse clinical or safety data related to the platform that could trigger recalls, label changes, or reputational damage.
- Pricing pressure from large hospital systems, particularly in Europe, where a competitor is already discounting.

**Factor and exposure risks**

- Concentrated exposure to healthcare equipment and mid-cap growth factors. A factor rotation out of growth / quality into value or cyclicals could hurt the stock even if fundamentals are on track.
- Revenue is skewed to the US with some euro cost exposure; a sharp USD move could create FX noise in reported results and sentiment.

**Event and calendar risks**

- Upcoming earnings are a focal point: any slowdown in procedure growth, weaker order trends, or cautious commentary on capital budgets would challenge the thesis.
- The FDA decision on the new indication is a binary event. A delay or negative outcome would significantly reduce upside and likely compress the multiple.
- Industry conference commentary can reset expectations quickly if management tones down growth language or competitors announce superior data.

**Concentration, liquidity, and correlation considerations**

- At 3% of the portfolio, this is a meaningful single-name risk; correlation with other medtech holdings or broader growth factor exposures should be monitored.
- Liquidity is generally adequate for a mid-cap, but position size should reflect the potential gap risk around regulatory or clinical news.

Overall, the position’s risk is acceptable for a 12–18 month growth thesis, but it requires tight monitoring of adoption metrics, regulatory milestones, and factor exposures, with a clear plan to reduce or exit if guidance momentum stalls or safety concerns emerge.
