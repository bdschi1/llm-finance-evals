# Equity research golden answer – ER case 1 (Acme MedTech)

**Stance:** Long

Acme MedTech is a mid-cap surgical tools and monitoring company with a growing base of recurring revenue from disposable instruments and services. The core driver over the next 12–18 months is adoption of its new surgical platform, which is already showing up in double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion.

The long thesis is that procedure growth plus mix shift to the new platform can sustain low- to mid-teens top-line growth, while operating leverage and a richer disposable mix expand margins. Management has started to raise guidance, suggesting healthy visibility, and the tuck-in imaging software acquisition strengthens the technology story and could support pricing power over time.

Variant perception is that the market still underestimates both the durability of procedure growth and the incremental margin from higher utilization of the installed base. Concerns about competitive pricing in Europe are real but manageable, given that Europe is a minority of revenue and the company can defend share with better workflow integration and clinical support.

Key risks include slower-than-expected adoption of the new platform, negative data or safety issues that could stall growth, and more aggressive discounting by a large competitor that compresses margins. A broader slowdown in elective procedures or hospital capex would also pressure the thesis. Position sizing should reflect medtech product and regulatory risk, and the need to reassess if guidance momentum stalls for more than a quarter.
