# Results Folder

This directory stores the output of evaluation runs.

Expected files generated by the evaluation config:

- `scored_output.json` — component-level scores for a model output
- `log.txt` — optional log messages from the scoring script or run wrapper

These files are produced when executing:python scoring/score_output.py

This folder is kept under version control so that users cloning the repo
have a complete directory structure.
