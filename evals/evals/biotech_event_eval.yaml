name: Biotech clinical / regulatory event reasoning
description: >
  Evaluate whether an LLM can structure base/bull/bear scenarios and positioning
  around a key biotech event (e.g., Phase 3 readout, FDA decision), given a brief
  trial summary, prior data, and company context.

task_type: generation

inputs:
  - id: trial_summary
    description: >
      3–6 sentence description of the trial: indication, phase, patient population,
      primary endpoint(s), and timing of readout or decision.
  - id: prior_data
    description: >
      Bulleted list of key prior data points or precedent studies (if any),
      including any red flags (safety, efficacy, trial design).
  - id: company_context
    description: >
      2–4 sentences describing company size, pipeline mix, balance sheet, and how
      important this event is to the overall equity story.

outputs:
  - id: scenario_tree
    description: >
      Short base/bull/bear scenario tree for the event, with associated directional
      impact on the stock and rough probability statements.
  - id: positioning_view
    description: >
      2–4 paragraphs describing how a fundamental PM might size, hedge, or avoid
      the event, given the scenario tree and portfolio context.

rubric:
  dimensions:
    - id: event_understanding
      label: Event and endpoint understanding
      weight: 0.25
      description: >
        Does the model correctly interpret the trial design, endpoints, and the
        importance of the event for the stock?
      scale: 1-5

    - id: scenario_quality
      label: Scenario structure and calibration
      weight: 0.30
      description: >
        Are base/bull/bear scenarios well-defined, internally consistent, and
        plausibly calibrated (not all 33/33/33 or obviously biased)?
      scale: 1-5

    - id: positioning_logic
      label: Positioning and risk logic
      weight: 0.25
      description: >
        Does the positioning view tie scenario probabilities to position sizing,
        hedging, and correlation with the rest of the book?
      scale: 1-5

    - id: risk_awareness
      label: Risk awareness and tail thinking
      weight: 0.20
      description: >
        Does the answer identify key tail risks (e.g., safety issues, trial design flaws,
        financing risk) and how they would be managed?
      scale: 1-5
