# Example Input: Earnings Research Thesis and Risk (v1)

This is a synthetic example of the input package for the eval
`earnings_research_thesis_and_risk_v1`.

In a full implementation, the input would bundle:

- A short **company profile** (business model, segments, geography).
- Excerpts from the latest **10-K** and **10-Q**:
  - Revenue and segment trends,
  - Margin and cash-flow commentary,
  - Key risk disclosures.
- A brief **earnings call / management commentary** excerpt.
- A one-page synthetic **buyside/sellside summary** highlighting:
  - Consensus thesis,
  - Bull and bear points,
  - Current valuation vs history.

For now, this file serves as a placeholder and schema example so that the
eval definition and golden answer can be wired up end-to-end.
Concrete company content can be added later without changing the structure.
