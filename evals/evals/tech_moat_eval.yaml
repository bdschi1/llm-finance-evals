name: Technology competitive moat and disruption analysis
description: >
  Evaluate whether an LLM can produce a credible analysis of a technology company’s
  competitive moat, disruption risks, and monetization paths, given a product and
  ecosystem summary.

task_type: generation

inputs:
  - id: product_overview
    description: >
      3–6 sentences describing the company’s core products, platform, and business model.
  - id: ecosystem_context
    description: >
      Bulleted list of major competitors, partners, and relevant platform dependencies.
  - id: current_developments
    description: >
      3–5 bullets on recent product launches, strategy shifts, or regulatory headlines.

outputs:
  - id: moat_analysis
    description: >
      3–6 paragraphs assessing the company’s moat (technology, data, distribution,
      switching costs) and how durable it is over the next 3–5 years.
  - id: disruption_and_monetization
    description: >
      2–4 paragraphs discussing key disruption risks and credible monetization paths,
      including how the company might pivot if the current model comes under pressure.

rubric:
  dimensions:
    - id: moat_clarity
      label: Clarity of moat and sources of edge
      weight: 0.30
      description: >
        Does the answer clearly articulate why this company wins or loses (product,
        data, distribution, ecosystem position) vs named competitors?
      scale: 1-5

    - id: time_horizon_and_durability
      label: Time horizon and moat durability
      weight: 0.20
      description: >
        Does the analysis explicitly consider 3–5 year durability vs short-term noise?
      scale: 1-5

    - id: disruption_logic
      label: Disruption and platform risk logic
      weight: 0.25
      description: >
        Are disruption risks and platform dependencies identified and discussed
        with realistic mechanisms, not generic “tech risk” boilerplate?
      scale: 1-5

    - id: monetization_insight
      label: Monetization and strategic options
      weight: 0.25
      description: >
        Does the model identify plausible monetization paths and strategic pivots,
        and connect them to P&L and valuation?
      scale: 1-5
