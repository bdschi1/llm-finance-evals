# Scoring Rubric: Earnings Research Thesis and Risk (v1)

Score each model output on a 1–5 scale for the dimensions below.
Use the golden answer as a reference pattern, not a verbatim target.

## 1. Factual Grounding (factual_grounding)

- **1** – Major factual errors or obvious hallucinations relative to the
  provided documents.
- **3** – Mostly accurate; minor slips do not change the overall thesis.
- **5** – Fully consistent with the input package; clearly grounded in
  the filings and research.

## 2. Business & Driver Understanding (driver_understanding)

- **1** – Generic commentary that could apply to many companies.
- **3** – Correct core drivers but limited nuance; some important KPIs
  missing or underdeveloped.
- **5** – Clear mapping from business model → KPIs → earnings/cash flow,
  with a sensible base-case narrative.

## 3. Risk Awareness (risk_awareness)

- **1** – Ignores obvious idiosyncratic or sector risks.
- **3** – Lists some risks but misses key ones or treats them shallowly.
- **5** – Identifies the main idiosyncratic, sector, and macro risks and
  links them explicitly to thesis and sizing.

## 4. Conviction Levers & Event Path (conviction_levers_and_event_path)

- **1** – Little sense of what would change conviction or size; no real
  event path.
- **3** – Some events and levers, but not clearly prioritized or tied to
  position changes.
- **5** – Explicit event path and conviction levers; clear statements of
  how new information (good/bad/base) would change conviction and position
  size, even if the thesis direction stays the same.

## 5. Positioning & Risk Use (positioning_and_risk_use)

- **1** – No sizing or portfolio context beyond “buy/sell”.
- **3** – Basic notion of “small vs core” but weak risk framing.
- **5** – Clear use of **risk units**, role in the book, and risk limits:
  - Contribution to portfolio volatility/drawdown,
  - Factor vs idiosyncratic risk,
  - Conditions for trimming or exiting.

## 6. Clarity and Structure (clarity_and_structure)

- **1** – Disorganized; hard to follow; unclear sections.
- **3** – Understandable but rough or incomplete in structure.
- **5** – PM-quality structure, easy to read and review, with clearly
  labeled sections that match the expected output schema.

Scores can be averaged for a simple overall score, or weighted more heavily
toward risk-related dimensions depending on use case.
