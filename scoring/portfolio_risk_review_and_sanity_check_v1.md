# Scoring Rubric: Portfolio Risk Review and Sanity Check (v1)

Score each model output on a 1–5 scale for the dimensions below.
Use the golden answer as a reference pattern, not a verbatim target.

## 1. Risk Decomposition Understanding (risk_decomposition_understanding)

- **1** – Misreads or ignores basic risk components; confuses factor vs
  idiosyncratic risk.
- **3** – Correctly identifies major components (market, sectors, some
  factors, idiosyncratic risk) but with limited nuance.
- **5** – Clear, accurate explanation of how total risk is decomposed and
  how each component contributes to total volatility/drawdown.

## 2. Intentional vs Accidental Risk (intentional_vs_accidental_risk)

- **1** – Treats all observed exposures as if they were intentional; no
  distinction between core themes and residual bets.
- **3** – Recognizes some unintended exposures but misses key ones or does
  not explain why they matter.
- **5** – Explicitly distinguishes intended vs accidental risks, with clear
  reasoning about why certain exposures are problematic or misaligned with
  stated objectives.

## 3. Concentration and Crowding Insight (concentration_and_crowding_insight)

- **1** – No meaningful analysis of single-name or theme concentration.
- **3** – Identifies a few large positions or themes but does not connect
  them to drawdown risk or crowding.
- **5** – Highlights single-name, sector, and thematic concentrations;
  comments on potential crowding/overlap and its implications for
  drawdown and liquidity risk.

## 4. Actionability of Recommendations (actionability_of_recommendations)

- **1** – Vague suggestions (“diversify”, “reduce risk”) with no concrete
  trades or sizing changes.
- **3** – Some specific trades or adjustments, but they are small, generic,
  or not clearly tied to identified risks.
- **5** – Clear, specific, and actionable rebalance plan (trims, adds,
  pairs, hedges) with direct links to the issues identified in the risk
  review and a sense of magnitude.

## 5. Alignment with Risk-Budget Mindset (alignment_with_risk_budget_mindset)

- **1** – Speaks only in dollar or notional terms; ignores risk units and
  risk budget.
- **3** – References risk and sizing but does not clearly think in terms of
  a finite risk budget or marginal risk.
- **5** – Explicitly frames proposals in terms of risk units and risk
  budget: which slices (factors, sectors, names, scenarios) consume how
  much risk, and how the rebalance improves **alpha per unit of marginal
  risk**.

## 6. Clarity and Structure (clarity_and_structure)

- **1** – Disorganized; difficult to follow the review or recommendations.
- **3** – Understandable but rough; some sections missing or weakly
  separated.
- **5** – Well-structured risk memo with clear sections matching the
  expected output schema; reads like a PM-to-risk/IC review.

Scores can be averaged for a simple overall score, or weighted more heavily
toward dimensions 2–5 for use cases that care most about **risk usage**
rather than narrative quality.
